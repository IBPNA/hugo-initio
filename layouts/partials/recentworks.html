                <p>The Lord Jesus assures us: “I am the good shepherd, and I know mine and mine know me.” This divine communion with Our Lord is founded on our faith and on the Sacraments, and is lived in reciprocity of knowledge and in charity; in short, in true friendship: “I have called you friends, because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.” The members of the Institute of the Good Shepherd strive to live this communion, this knowledge, and this charity in our daily lives. But because Christ proclaims the Good News to all people, whether they belong to the Catholic faithful or not, as the Father sent His Son to all, it is right that this reciprocal knowledge of Shepherd and the sheep should pass through these friends, these ministers, whom the Lord has chosen. This is why St. Paul says, “we are ambassadors for Christ, as if God were appealing through us,” and our burning desire will be to always give to everyone the hope founded on the supreme good of knowing Christ Jesus.</p>

				<p>The Institute of Good Shepherd will always have this paramount mission: “To spread among the nations the goodness of Jesus Christ.” But because these are difficult times in which the charity of a great many has grown cold and because “the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine,” the Lord’s ministers, by preaching the word, need to “proclaim the word; be persistent whether it is convenient or inconvenient; convince, reprimand, encourage.”</p>

				<p>We do this “through all patience and teaching.” We seek to advance in all pastoral kindness, with zeal and sensitivity, the teachings of the Magisterium and the beauty of faith in Him Who alone can give eternal life. We rely on the Lord, our Master, and in Divine Providence which has carried our young Institute thus far, to keep us serene and fruitful in this mission, for the honor of the Most Holy Trinity.</p>
